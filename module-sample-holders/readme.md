## Sample holder module

This is an important, but less high-tech part of the workstation and needs to be particularly adaptable to accomodate using a variety of samples.
The sample holder module attaches to the pressure control module and clamps the sample tubes into place, so that pressure inlets and thin sample outlet tubing can be attached securely, before pressures up to several bar can be applied to the sample tubes (e.g. eppendorf tubes, falcon tubes, glass bottles).
