# Open Microfluidics Workstation

Repository for the development of the *compact* *modules* of a free and *open source* microfluidic workstation, for *high-throughput droplet microfluidic* biological assays. It addresses gas-pressure control to push microfluidic samples onto chips, pressure and flow measurement with feedback controll, sample holders with heating and stirring, and imaging of fast droplet generation processes with open source microscopy and stroboscopic illumination.

The aim is to create a prototype of a *compact* working station that is based on *connectable*, *open*, modern and *low-cost* components (RasberriPi, Adrunio, 3D printing, on-board components, open or at least accessible design software and operation software - python). This workstation is aimed to be a fully functional research grade equipment with good specifications, such as fast reaction times and low pressure fluctuations. It is modular, so that parts of the workstation can be repurposed and improved in the open source hardware sense, and also easily be combined, exchanged or used on their own in challenging environments such as an anaerobic chamber. This is an open collaborative project and *your participation* (comments, inputs, contributions) are explicitly welcome! Please submit your message as an issue in this repository to participate.
