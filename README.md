# Open Microfluidics Workstation

Repository for the development of the *modular* parts of a free and *open source* microfluidic workstation, for *high-throughput droplet microfluidic* biological assays.

The aim is to create a prototype of a *compact* working station that is based on *connectable*, *open*, modern and *low-cost* components (RasberriPi, Adrunio, 3D printing, on-board components, open or at least accessible design software and operation software - python). This workstation is aimed to be a fully functional research grade equipment with good specifications, such as fast reaction times and low pressure fluctuations. It is modular, so that parts of the workstation can be repurposed and improved in the open source hardware sense, serving scientific development. This is an open collaborative project and *your participation* (comments, inputs, contributions) are explicitly welcome!
