## Fast imaging module for microfluidic droplet generation

Imaging unit based on compact 3D printed microscope (https://gitlab.com/openflexure/openflexure-microscope), with Objective (10x?)

Depending on the load demand, it could operate on the Raspberri Pi computer of the central workstation unit, have it's own computer, and transfer images to a webserver.


### Approach Nr.1 Integrated camera

Low-cost integrated use of Raspberri Pi Camera V2 and scripting to vary image size vs. frame rate.

### Approach Nr.2 USB3 camera

Use of high-speed camera and USB3 connection on the Raspberri Pi 4

E.g. Compact cameras from Allied Vision 

Camera Mako U-051B mono; 800x600 CMOS C-Mount 391fps 10bit-ADC 128MB-buffer; ca. 340 Euro net

Camera Mako U-029B mono; 640x480 CMOS C-Mount 550fps 10bit-ADC 128MB-buffer; ca. 300 Euro net
